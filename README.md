# Vaccine Refrigerator IoT on AWS
 
This Vaccine Refrigerator solution is an educational project to showcase how an ordinary home refrigerator is transformed into a smart vaccine refrigerator that performs automatic temperature monitoring and recording, abnormal temperature alert, real-time inventory level monitoring, and alerts for vaccine low-stock level or impending stock expiration. This solution uses the Internet of Things (IoT) concept and is performed on the Amazon Web Services (AWS). It uses AWS lambda functions to simulate the mock temperature sensor and bar code scanner for inventory management. Other AWS resources such as AWS IoT, AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS), and AWS DynamoDB are also used. Finally, Python code on Jupyter Notebook is used to process the data collected into various visualisations of temperature recordings and vaccine stock inventory level.
